# Turned-Legends-Development
Turned Legends is a strategic role-playing game that combines classic turn-based combat with an exciting dungeon-crawling mode. Players can dive into two different gameplay experiences: the standard turn-based mode, where careful planning and tactical choices are key to defeating opponents, and the dungeon game mode, which allows players to explore treacherous environments, battle a variety of enemies, and discover hidden treasures. In Turned Legends, your heroes will face fierce foes, unlock powerful abilities, and grow stronger as they progress through increasingly challenging encounters. With diverse character classes, and immersive environments, Turned Legends** offers a deep and engaging experience for strategy and RPG fans alike.
